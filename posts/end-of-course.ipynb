    "I chose to focus on experimentation and social responsibility. Through the process of blog posts and the final project I think I learned a lot in the category of experimentation, in terms of analyzing models and creating visualizations. I tried to weave social responsibility into my final project, focusing on how identity factors are perceived by a model to influence health outcomes. I do wish there had been a social responsibility option for a blog post, as I was unable to attend and write about the Women in Data Science conference. I thought about proposing one, but I didn't have the time to sit down and outline a blog post, and so it ended up being more feasible to focus on already created ones."

    "My original goal at the start of the semester was to complete 90% of the blog posts, which I quickly realized was pretty unfeasible. I also emphasized following the best-by dates pretty strictly, which was also a bit unrealistic for my real schedule. In my mid-semester reflection I revised to aiming for 8 total posts, and attempting to do them all to the best quality I could. This was a much more realistic goal, and one that I am proud I was able to accomplish. Instead of following best-by dates I attempted to always be working on a blog post, and allowing for a post to take longer than the single week assigned to it in the schedule so that I could be more thorough and detail-oriented. I always completed any revisions given to my blog posts until they reached E quality.  \n",
    "I am very proud of the work I have done on my blog posts. I feel like I have accomplished a lot in terms of both quality and quantity of posts. I found the practical implementations of topics we learned about in lecture and readings incredibly useful for my understanding, and I feel like my blog posts truly reflect my knowledge of the many subjects we've talked about."

I am very proud that I believe I accomplished both of these goals. There were maybe three warm-ups that I and classmates I worked with felt completely lost on and so did not have anything to present with, but I feel that all other times I was either prepared with my own work or had worked with a classmate before classtime to understand a confusing warm-up.\n",

I also planned to meet weekly with my team and set up a fair division of labor, which we sucessfully did. I think we worked especially well in that we each brought our own strengths to the project, which made working together really productive. One of my goals was also to take the lead on the formatting of the final project legends and figures, which I did in completeing our results section. I was happy that I had the opportunity to utilize and practice my skills in that particular area. My ideal project from my first reflection in many ways was the exact project that I completed, in that it covered an aspect of fairness in healthcare and medical outcomes, which I was really grateful for having found project partners with similar goals."
